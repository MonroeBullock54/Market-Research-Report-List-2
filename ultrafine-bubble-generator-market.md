<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultrafine Bubble Generator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gas-Water Circulation Type</li><li>Pressurized Dissolution Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Ultrafine Bubble Generator market comprises two primary types: Gas-Water Circulation Type and Pressurized Dissolution Type. The Gas-Water Circulation Type utilizes a water circulation system to produce ultrafine bubbles through a gas injection process, enhancing dispersion and saturation. In contrast, the Pressurized Dissolution Type employs high-pressure conditions to dissolve gas into water, resulting in finely dispersed bubbles when the pressure is released. Both methods aim to improve water treatment, enhance chemical reactions, and increase oxygen levels effectively.</p></p>
