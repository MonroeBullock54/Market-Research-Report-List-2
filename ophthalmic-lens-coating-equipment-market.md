<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ophthalmic Lens Coating Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dip Coating</li><li>Spin Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ophthalmic lens coating equipment market primarily features two main types: dip coating and spin coating. Dip coating involves immersing lenses into a liquid coating solution, allowing for uniform coverage and thickness. This method is ideal for larger production runs. In contrast, spin coating applies a liquid coating while the lens is spinning at high speeds, resulting in a thin, even layer. Spin coating is suitable for precise applications and smaller batches. Both methods contribute to enhanced lens performance and durability.</p></p>
