<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pharmaceutical Propellants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquefied Gases</li><li>Compressed Gases</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pharmaceutical propellants market is primarily divided into liquefied gases and compressed gases. Liquefied gases, like propane and butane, are stored under pressure and vaporize upon release, enabling efficient delivery of aerosol medications. Compressed gases, such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide, maintain pressure without liquefaction, providing a stable means of propelling products. Both types play crucial roles in the formulation of inhalers and aerosol sprays, ensuring precise dosages and effective drug delivery in various therapeutic applications.</p></p>
